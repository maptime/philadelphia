On Monday, April 6, 2015, MaptimePHL met at Indy Hall to learn the fundamentals of accessibility on the web. [LeeAnn Kinney](https://twitter.com/_leekinney), a front-end developer and organizer for [Girl Develop It Philadelphia](https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/philadelphia), gave us a motivating introduction to making our work available to more people. Continue reading for a brief synopsis of the evening, stick around to the end and you'll find links to topic specific resources, and a slew of announcements (including upcoming events) at the end.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Thereâ€™s more users with disabilities than people using IE8. &#10;&#10;Still, we tend to drop accessibility in favour of IE8 support.&#10;&#10; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fronteers14?src=hash">#fronteers14</a></p>&mdash; Rik Schennink (@rikschennink) <a href="https://twitter.com/rikschennink/status/520521059884617728">October 10, 2014</a></blockquote>

An alarming tweet (for many reasons) as is, which somehow still inadequately communicates why accessibility is so important. Luckily for us, we had an expert on hand to provide the necessary context. 

LeeAnn described accessibility as **making technology useful to as many people as possible**, and is part of our *responsibility* to treat other people with *respect*, be *accountable*, and demonstrate *leadership*. She encouraged us, as creators of maps and many other things, to integrate accessibility considerations into our workflows early in the process instead of as an afterthought at the end. 

We spent the rest of the evening in smaller groups, exploring accessibility through hands on activities. In one group, LeeAnn led a mini accessibility audit of a website that one of the mapheads was working on. In another group, attendees used a tool called [Vischeck](http://http://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/vischeckImage.php), which simulates color blindness, to review the accessibility of maps they found online. 


### Resources

* LeeAnn posted [her slides on the web](http://leekinney.github.io/MaptimePHL/#/) which contains a bunch of links to studies, tools, and standards to guide your accessibility efforts.

* [A fantastic blog post about maps and accessibility](http://www.azavea.com/blogs/atlas/2014/12/a-new-vision-for-accessible-maps/) written by Sarah Cordivano.

* [Unlock Philly](http://www.unlockphilly.com/) open-sources, crowd-sourced, data comprise this web map showing the level of accessibility at various localtions around Philly.

* [Color Brewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/), a tool for creating colorblind-safe map palettes backed by real science.

* [A more accessible map](http://alistapart.com/article/cssmaps) slightly dated but still worthwhile hands on tutorial for creating an accessible map entirely out of html, css, and javascript step-by-step.

* [Vischeck](http://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/vischeckImage.php), upload images and simulate three types of color blindness. 

* And a few other interesting accessibility related resources: [Accessibility Wins](http://a11ywins.tumblr.com/), searching for "accessibility" on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/), and a new [a11y Slack group](http://web-a11y.herokuapp.com/).


### Announcements & Upcoming meetings

* ICYMI, [Philly Tech Week 2015](http://2015.phillytechweek.com/) is right around the corner. Join our friends at GeoPhilly on **Wednesday, April 22** for a [balloon mapping event](http://www.meetup.com/GeoPhilly/events/220196293/) on the waterfront! That's right: GeoPhilly will be at the Independence Seaport Museum to teach you how to take aerial photos with balloons and stitch those photos into maps.

* MaptimePHL has a website! Since you're reading this recap you already knew that, but it was under wraps until the meeting. The site is going to be a home for event info (announcements & recaps), general Philly geo happenings, and more.

* Mark your calendars for Wednesday, April 29th because MaptimePHL is having another option night, where you can get together with other map enthusiasts to learn and create in a welcoming, collaborative environment. It'll be fun, so bring your friends.

* Also upcoming: On May 30, MaptimePHL is hosting an Open Street Map Food Resources Hackathon with Sterling Quinn.
