title: Excuse Me, Did You Say Maptime?

---

When [Patrick](https://twitter.com/hamhandedly) and I decided to start a maptime chapter here in Philly about a year ago, we told everyone and anyone willing to listen. Without fail this led to one of the two following reactions:

Smiles and laughter because the person thought we said *nap* time (for real though, how is naptime not a meetup?!)

*or* the question ... 

#### what is maptime?

To this day it remains one of the most popular questions people ask and rightly so. 

Maptime, **literally a time for making and learning about maps with friends**, is easy to grasp conceptually. But as recently as two years ago, not even the founding members expected it to become the movement it is today, including more than 40 volunteer led chapters (and growing weekly!) worldwide as well as a rockstar core team ([Beth](https://twitter.com/bethschechter), [Alan](https://twitter.com/mappingmashups), [Lyzi](https://twitter.com/lyzidiamond) and [Camille](https://twitter.com/fulgenteft)) holding down the fort at [MaptimeHQ](https://twitter.com/MaptimeHQ).

Plus, without the firsthand experience of having attended a maptime meeting, it's *not easy* to reconcile how something so simple in theory, spending time making maps with others, can have such a powerful impact in practice.

**SPOILER ALERT**: It does! :-)

To fully appreciate where Maptime is today, its important to first understand the why, when, and how maptime came to be. So I went straight to the source, and pulled the following excerpt from [a History of Maptime](http://maptime.io/about/):

Maptime started as an *idea* at the [2013 State of the Map US conference](http://stateofthemap.us/2013/) in *response* to a talk **by Alyssa Wright** [challenging the lack of diversity in OpenStreetMap contributions](http://vimeopro.com/openstreetmapus/state-of-the-map-us-2013/video/68098504). Inspired and wanting to become a better mapmaker too, Beth decided that she wanted to make time, once a week, to get together with friends and make maps. Camille liked the idea and helped to host the first one at Stamenâ€™s office.

And so Maptime was born, at about 6:30 p.m. on June 13, 2013, in San Francisco, CA:

#### so the idea of maptime makes sense, but how does it work irl? 

From an operations perspective, MaptimeHQ handles the important responsibilities involved with developing the strong foundation necessary to ensure a sustainable institution (e.g., bylaws, 501(c)3 non-profit status). 

**Equally importantly**, MaptimeHQ *enables* local chapter organizers **to succeed** by fostering a positive, welcoming, and constructive environment full of support, rainbows, and high-fives. They lead the way, but also stay out of the way, so chapter organizers have the autonomy to create unique sub-communities reflective of (and appropriate for) their home cities.

At the local level, (essentially local organizers take idea of maptime, protect it, add to it). Groups meet 1-2x a month, sometimes to just hang out and make maps and sometimes to learn about specific topics. 

Throughout it all, learning as much about what it takes to create successful mapping communities as we do about cartography and spatial analysis. And sharing tutorials, tips, and words of encouragement in an attempt to perpetually evolve our community for the better. 


#### This all sounds awesome, can I join maptime? 

Maptime is an *open* learning community by default. Are you a nice person? Are you interested in learning and maps? If the answer to both of these questions is yes, then you can join! 

That being said, a post attempting to provide a clear vision of what maptime *is* would not be complete without acknowledging what maptime *is not*. 

See our [Code of Conduct](http://maptime.io/code-of-conduct/), which describes what maptime *is not* clearly and specifically. Well worth the time it takes to read, regardless of whether you are a prospective member *or* a current member.

#### Philly can haz maptime?

You can find our chapter on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/maptimephl/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maptimephl). For any questions or comments, send us a note via email - philly@maptime.io

And keep an eye out for a follow up post next week, which will explore the specifics of what makes our chapter here in Philly different ...

**NOTE**: The images above are slides from a presentation Beth and Lyzi gave at F0SS4GNA 2015 about the very same topic. It's so, so good and goes above and beyond the contents of this post.
