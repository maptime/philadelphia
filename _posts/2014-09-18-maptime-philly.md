title: It's Maptime, Philly!
---

Hey Philly! It's maptime! And we even have a website! How about that?

Maptime is for anyone who loves maps and wants to learn more about them. Every month we come together to hack maps, delve into the world of geospatial data, and learn about the latest cartographic tools in an extremely beginner-friendly environment. Maptime is hands-on, so bring your laptops and get ready to help build some cool stuff with an inclusive community of map nerds. All skill levels are welcome!

For more on Maptime and the general ethos, check out [maptime.io](http://www.maptime.io/about/).
