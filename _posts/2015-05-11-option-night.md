title: "[Event Announcement] What's the deal with option night?"

one part study hall, one part hack night, with a dash of fun for good measure. mix these all together and you have the recipe for option night.

inspired by the underlying spirit behind jam sessions and knitting circles, **the primary goal of option night is to create a safe, welcoming place where people can learn together.**

having this shared space creates the opportunity to *practice skills* we cover at activity nights, *ask questions*, work on personal/group projects, or *just hang out and meet people* who share the same interests you may not otherwise.

you have the *option* to do what you want.

this matchmaking becomes especially powerful when you run into someone who knows a lot about a specific area or topic you want to learn more about. very likely considering the awesome, talented people and range of backgrounds/skill-sets within our community.

maptimePHL will host option night once a month as a complement to our activity nights. as always, no prior experience necessary. simply an interest in maps and learning new things!

as always, food and drinks provided by [Azavea](http://www.azavea.com/), our super cool and awesome sponsor.

**note**: MaptimePHL events are Bring Your Own Laptop (BYOL). If you would like to attend but bringing a laptop is an issue, contact one of the organizers via email - philly@maptime.io - and we will find a solution.
