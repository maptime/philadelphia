Get ready for our first field trip! The folks at Azavea generously offered to host MaptimePHL at their office, 340 N. 12th Street - Suite 402, on October 13th. While we love it at Indy Hall, it's time to visit some of the other spaces which make Philadelphia such an incredible city. We'll decide on the topic during the Leaflet workshop, so mark your calendars and stay tuned!
