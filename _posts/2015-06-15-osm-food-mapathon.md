title: "[RECAP] Philly Food Resources Mapathon"

*What follows is the first (of hopefully many) guest posts to our blog. The author, Sterling Quinn, is a graduate student in the Department of Geography at Penn State University and recently facilitated one of our events. He was also nice enough to write up a recap for those who were unable to attend.*

On May 31, I visited MaptimePHL to show how [OpenStreetMap](www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/40.0024/-74.9982) (OSM) can store information about community food resources in a common digital location. 

OSM is a free online map of the world that anyone can edit, similar in style to Wikipedia. Editing the map is fun and straightforward, and can be learned in a few minutes. At last week's State of the Map conference, Britta Ricker even described OSM as a ["gateway drug" to deeper learning](http://stateofthemap.us/evolving-technology-shifting-expectations-cultivating-pedagogy-for-a-rapidly-changing-gis-landscape/) about geographic technologies.

While academics have noted that OSM has some hurdles to overcome before becoming truly democratic in nature, many positive and productive use cases currently exist. For example, **local-scale focused projects that have an enhusiastic volunteer base** work particularly well. 

One such project is the [Philly Fresh Food Map](http://www.geovista.psu.edu/phillyfood/), a custom website that downloads the latest food resources from OSM every night and places them on an interactive map of Philadelphia neighborhoods. In addition to informing citizens about nearby sites of food production and distribution, the map is meant to serve as a model for other communities interested in storing information about their food resources in OSM.

<h4>why is this so important?</h4>

Many farms and community gardens are located in low-income neighborhoods that appear as acres of empty blocks in commercial or government-produced online maps. OSM allows for sites of urban food production to be given a place on the map, opening the door to a bottom-up re-portrayal of space that emphasizes the production of basic daily needs.

So last year, Penn State researchers *proposed* and *documented* a **standard set of tags** for storing food resources in OSM, then amassed a number of student and community volunteers to gather Philadelphia's food data and add it to OSM. 

During the May 31st Maptime event, volunteers helped update the map data for 2015. This is *critical* for the map's success, as farmers markets change their hours, new gardens appear, and community supported agriculture providers update their drop sites each growing season.

If you'd like to help update the data, [you are welcome to download the handouts and instructions from the activity](http://www.personal.psu.edu/sdq107/maptime/food_in_osm.zip) and edit some data yourself. **Your local knowledge may add important resources to the map that would otherwise go missing.**
