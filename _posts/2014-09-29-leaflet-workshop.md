title: What's the deal with Leaflet?
rsvp: http://www.meetup.com/maptimePHL/events/207647862/
---

Our first workshop is going to be all about Leaflet, the popular javascript mapping library.

Never used Leaflet or written javascript before? No problem. **Chris Brown** will be leading a beginner-friendly intro to building webmaps. Come make some sweet maps with us!

Reminder: maptime is **hands-on**, so **bring a laptop**. We'll send more specifics out as we get closer to the meetup.
